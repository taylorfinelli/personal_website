          Greetings! My name is Taylor Finelli. I'm a senior studying computer science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Honors College.
          I'm currently on track to earn a bachelor's of science in computer science with a concentration in information assurance.
          My academic journey and experiences have shaped my love for technology, and I can't wait to share more with you.
          It's funny â€“ I wasn't always a big 'tech' guy, but COVID lockdowns and too much YouTube will really reveal some hidden passions.
          Anyway, keep scrolling to check out what makes me who I am.
